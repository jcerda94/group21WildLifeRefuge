|CAPI Exposed Variable|Purpose
|---------------------|-:|
|SimCount.redtailHawkCount|Controls the count of hawks when the simulation starts up|
|SimCount.snowshoeHareCount|Controls the count of hares when the simulation starts up|
|SimCount.sageBushCount|Controls the count of bushes when the simulation starts up|
|SimCount.westernCedarCount|Controls the count of trees when the simulation starts up|
|SimCount.grass|Controls the count of grass models when the simulation starts up|
|Hare.label|Boolean that controls whether the hare's label is visible|
|Hare.maleBias|Value between 0 and 100 that sets a bias for male hares being born, 100 would be all males, 0 would be all females|
|Hare.ovulationTime|The time (in seconds) between breeding cycles for hares. 86400 would be 1 simulation day between breeding.|
|Hare.sightRange|The distance a hare can see, this controls how close a hawk needs to be before it can be seen by the hare|
|Hare.metabolism|Metabolism rating for the hares, higher values mean slower metabolisms, the hare can go longer between eating|
|Hare.starvationTime|The time (in seconds) that it takes the hare to starve. The hare starves when it is at max hunger for this length of simulation time|
|WesternCedar.label|The label visibility for trees|
|Hawk.label|The label visibility for hawks|
|Hawk.metabolism|Hawk metabolism, same as hare metabolism but for hawks|
|Hawk.maleBias|Same as hare's male bias|
|Hawk.ovulationTime|Same as hare ovulation time|
|Hawk.starvationTime|Same as hare starvation time|
|redtailHawkSelected|Count of how many hawks are selected, not fully implemented|
|showshoeHareSelected|Count of how many hares are selected, not fully implemented|
|sageBushSelected|Count of how many bushes are selected, not fully implemented|
|westernCedarSelected|Count of how many trees are selected, not fully implemented|
